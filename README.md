- Heyo, My name is Harsh and I am a Combined Major in Science at University of British Columbia. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Artificial Intelligence and Database Management/Data Manipulation, mainly to spend a lot of extra time automating processes that I could just compelete manually.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Science, Physics, and Earth Science 
- Most of work is not public to avoid plagarism flags from the university. Please email a request to view projects.
